##Programming for interface Principle

We declare a variable that has a behavior declared in the interface.<br>Declare variable of type of interface gives us more flexibility.If later we decide to switch to a different implementation of that interface.<br>We won't need to change the type of the variable.
  ```java
ArrayList<Customer> customers = new ArrayList<Customer>();
  ```
While this code is correct,  there a better way of declaring the variable customers:
  ```java
List<Customer> customers = new ArrayList<Customer>();
  ```
From this example If later we decide to switch to a different implementation of the List (e.g. LinkedList instead of ArrayList ) we wonâ€™t need to change the type of the variable customers.

##The Single-Responsibility Principle

A class should have only one reason to change.

Picture1
 ```java
 public class Businessman{
  public Money investStocks(){...}
  public Money calculatePay(){...}
  public Conference conferenceTable(){...}
 }
 ```

Picture2
 ```java
 public class Businessman{
  public Money investStocks(){...}
 }
 public class Employee{
  public Money calculatePay(){...}
 }
 public class Secretory{
  public Conference conferenceTable(){...}
 }
 ```
